Dear Pandora Hiring Manager, \newline

As a computer engineer who has flourished in the intersection of hardware, software, and design, I would love for the opportunity to work and learn at Pandora. I am applying for a Backend Engineering Intern position posted on the Pandora Career Website. \newline

As a computer engineer I have a deep understanding of programming on Linux and developing software in Java as well as front end development. During my previous internship at Autodesk, I worked on a web application with a
large backend system and became familiar with networking and creating test environments in a
team-based scrim environment. I also communicated with the UX team from Autodesk Design Academy and our data analytics team to help influence my end project. 
As an intern, I can offer a competent software engineer with knowledge
of design and UI and a love of multidisciplinary teamwork. \newline

As a side note, I really enjoy creating communities and volunteering as an intern. At Autodesk I organized a Korean Fried Chicken going away dinner for all the interns (15+ interns) and cooked for the whole group in Autodesk Pier 9's test kitchen which I had to recieve fire safety training and food safety training for. In addition to work, I did volunteer work for unprivledged LGBTQIA+ youth (Maven Youth Program) and helped run some of their workshops. It was a great cause and I'm excited to volunteer for any opportunity that presents itself!\newline

I'm very excited for the opportunity to learn and I look forward to hearing back from you! Feel free to contact me by email or phone.\newline

Best regards, \par
Matthew Lim

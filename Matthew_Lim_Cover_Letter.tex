Dear Khan Academy Hiring Manager, \newline

As a computer engineer who flourishes in the intersection of software, design, and education, I would love for the opportunity to work and learn at Khan Academy. I am applying for the Software Developer Intern position posted on the Khan Academy Career Website. \newline

During my previous internship at Autodesk, I worked on a web application with a
large backend system and became familiar with networking and creating test environments in a
team-based scrim environment. The tool, Screencast, was designed to help viewers learn how to use Autodesk products by communicating keystrokes and menu settings on screen as a video played. This brought me to do user research into how viewers use this player and I contacted both Analytics teams and a UX team from another department to gain insight. I compiled that research and presented a "overhaul" to the team before I left. I believe the valuable insights I gained combined with my familiarity of web development make me a perfect candidate for this position. 
 \newline

Educational technology has always excited me as a former FIRST robotics member and user of Khan Academy itself.  It would be amazing to work at Khan Academy to support the education of everyone. I am currently enrolled in an Educational Technology class and the exciting developments being made in the field are inspiring.
\newline

I'm very excited for the opportunity to learn and I look forward to hearing back from you! Feel free to contact me by email or phone.\newline

Best regards, \par
Matthew Lim
